# MIPS-program
This was a 2-phase project we had to do as part of our coursework for Computer Architecture. We were instructed to make MIPS code to sort an array of integers  and make an assembler for the same, to change the code from assembly to binary language.

## How to run
### Running the MIPS program
1. Assemble and execute sorter.asm in the MIPS simulator.
2. On the command line, enter the number of integers to be sorted.
3. Enter a starting address that can be used as a starting address for the input array, similarly do the same for the starting address of the output array.
4. Enter the integers.
>Now the output array will be printed on the command line.

### Running the python assembler
1. Run the assembler.py file.
2. You will see binary code for the sorter.asm assembly code.
